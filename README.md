## Description

> This is an example of implementation of Clean Architecture in Go (Golang) projects.  
>
> Rule of Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob
>
>- Independent of Frameworks. The architecture does not depend on the existence of some library of feature laden software. This allows you to use such frameworks as tools, rather than having to cram your system into their limited constraints.
>- Testable. The business rules can be tested without the UI, Database, Web Server, or any other external element.
>- Independent of UI. The UI can change easily, without changing the rest of the system. A Web UI could be replaced with a console UI, for example, without changing the business rules.
>- Independent of Database. You can swap out Oracle or SQL Server, for Mongo, BigTable, CouchDB, or something else. Your business rules are not bound to the database.
>- Independent of any external agency. In fact your business rules simply donâ€™t know anything at all about the outside world.

This project has 4 Domain layer :

- Models Layer
  - This layer contains all the models of the application.
  - It should not depend on any other layer.
- Repository Layer
  - This layer contains all the database related operations.
- Infrastructure Layer
  - This layer contains all the external operations like sending an email, calling external API, etc.
- Usecase Layer
  - This layer contains all the business logic.
  - Transaction is also implemented in this layer.
- Delivery Layer
  - This layer contains all the delivery mechanism like HTTP, gRPC, etc.

### Tools Used

In this project, I use some tools listed below. But you can use any similar library that have the same purposes. But, well, different library will have different implementation type. Just be creative and use anything that you really need.

- All libraries listed in [`go.mod`](https://github.com/bxcodec/go-clean-arch/blob/master/go.mod)
- ["github.com/vektra/mockery".](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) To Generate Mocks for testing needs.
